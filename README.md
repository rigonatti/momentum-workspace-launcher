# Momentum-Workspace-Laucher v1.0.0

 A Alfred Workflow to kill any apps that won't be used and open only those you need.  

 Saving CPU/Memory, while keeping you focused. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I am focusing on doing things one at a time and paying full attention to whatever needs my attention. 

### Living with ADHD for decades, I learned how to setup my workflow to avoid any disruption to my attention spam. 

### That means closing any app that will not help me to achieve my goals at that moment.

### There are some apps that can launch a group of apps (or kill them) based on interface selection.

### The question for me was how to implement a simple workflow on Alfred (that I use for almost everything during my day) that will kill any apps (saving power and CPU/Memory) and then open only the Apps used for the purpose. 


#  üêæ Future Updates:

> 1. I'm planning to create a simple setup to name Workplaces and configure a list of apps grouped by usage. However, I still need some help to learn how to do it.

In the meantime, I hope you enjoy this workflow.

If you have any suggestions, please email me at momentum-workspace-launcher@rigonatti.com.

* Setup your workspace names.

  - If you choose to change the variable for each workspace, make sure the conditional object uses the same variable.

* Use the workspace keyword (or any other) to open the workspace selection
